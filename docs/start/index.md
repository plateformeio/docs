# Getting started

!!! warning "The documentation is under heavy development!"

    We're actively working on improving the documentation and adding new guides. We plan to cover most of the core features and concepts in the coming weeks. If you have any questions or need help, please don't hesitate to reach out to us on [GitHub Discussions]({{ links.repo.core }}/discussions) or [Discord]({{ links.social.discord }}).

    You can also [follow us on :fontawesome-brands-x-twitter:]({{ links.social.x }}) for updates and announcements.

!!! tip "Check the features page for a quick overview"

    You can start by [exploring the features](features.md) to get an overview of the framework's capabilities and integrations.

[**Plateforme**](../index.md) provides a powerful foundation for building data-driven applications and services with all the features and integrations you need to get started quickly and scale efficiently. Whether you're creating a small project or a large-scale application, these guides will help you get started and make the most of the framework's capabilities.

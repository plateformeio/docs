!!! danger "Security vulnerabilities"

    **Do not disclose a vulnerability until a fix is in place.** 

    If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it immediately via email to [**{{ links.mail.security }}**](mailto:{{ links.mail.security }}), providing detailed steps to reproduce the issue and include example code when possible like you would for a regular bug report.

## Reporting a vulnerability

The latest version of Plateforme is supported.

If you think you've discovered a security vulnerability, even if you're not entirely certain about it, we encourage you to report it immediately by emailing [**{{ links.mail.security }}**](mailto:{{ links.mail.security }}). To help us investigate effectively:

- [x] Provide detailed steps that would allow us to reproduce the potential security issue
- [x] Include example code demonstrating the vulnerability whenever possible
- [x] Share any additional context or observations that might help us understand the impact and scope

## Public discussions

If you believe you've discovered a potential security vulnerability, please refrain from discussing it publicly. A private disclosure allows us to investigate and implement fixes before potential exposure, significantly reducing security risks for all users. Work with us directly through the reporting process outlined above.

## Best practices

You are encouraged to keep your project secure by [writing tests](../learn/guides/testing.md) and updating Plateforme frequently after verifying test success. Each update brings new features, bug fixes, and **security patches**. Check our documentation for [version pinning and upgrade](releases.md) best practices.
